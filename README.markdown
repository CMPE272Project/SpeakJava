SPEECH CODER
---------------------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION
Speech Coder is a revolutionary application that takes voice as input
and generates java code. The code created is free of syntax errors
thus enabling programmers to focus on logic rather than syntax.
#DESCRIPTION
Speech-Coder uses state of the art Google Speech recognition
technology to convert voice inputs from the user to text and feeds
them to an intelligent interpreter. This interpreter generates code
blocks and renders them to the code editor. The interpreter creates
composite structures before performing the rendering process. This
application has been designed to be simple and effective. The level
of abstraction attained by this tool makes coding in Java extremely
easy even for the most novice of programmers. A syntax error free
code is guaranteed as the editor is Java Aware. The editor allows
coding via typing as well as with voice input.
The editor consists of two text areas namely the JsyntaxPane and a
customConsole. JsyntaxPane is an Editor text Area which highlights
keywords giving it a look and feel of Java. IT also supports C++, C#,
python, JavaScript and The CustomConsole pane is a Text area that
displays system prompts to the programmers. When the java file is
compiled or run the error stream and the output stream are written to
customConsole pane.
#RUNNING THE APPLICATION
To run the application, first, download the project, add it to eclipse,
and run the file SpeechCoder.java from cmpe272.editor package.
See the guidelines file to execute your "hello world!" program.
The application runs in key inmode(typing). The user can press the
“start speech recognition mode” button to start giving the voice
inputs. The interaction with the application is menu driven and the
robot guides the programmers throughout the coding process. After the
code has been written in the JsyntxPane the user can speak commands
in the order save filename->compile filename-> run filename. The
output of the run/error messages due to compilation or run are
printed in the custom console.
